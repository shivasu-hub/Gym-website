<h1>WEIGHT LOSS</h1>
<p>We know that many new members have struggled with diet and fitness in the past and are looking to CrossFit as a long term lifestyle change. That’s huge and it could be one of the biggest selling points of your blog. By including meaningful, understanding and relatable weight loss articles, you will connect with readers who may be too afraid to take the next step and actually come into the gym. Show them that educated CrossFit trainers have a balanced view on weight loss and that YOU and your facility can help them to make long term change in their life-long fitness journey.
 Bonus points for including some real life member stories and progress photos in these ones.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h1>NUTRITION</h1>
<p>We know that good nutrition and CrossFit go hand in hand and so your trainers and members probably have some great tips for your blog. From the best breakfasts through to the worst snacks, your nutrition blog section is sure to get shared all around town!
 Check out these blog ideas for CrossFit Gym to get your started:</p>
<br><br><br>

<h1> EATING AND DIETING</h1>
<p>The main component of a toning up is the eating. Your food plan needs to be based on your macronutrient ratios, so your body is getting exactly what it needs from fats, carbohydrates and proteins. You will need to be eating a calorie deficit in order to shed body fat. If you have enjoyed personal training in Abu Dhabi then you will be familiar with how personal trainers help construct a meal plan. 
As the weeks go on, your food will change, carbohydrates usually become timed around your workouts to optimise their usage, and nearer to show day, they become less and less. 
Your eating regime should be tweaked and changed as you get closer and closer to your goal to keep the body fat coming off. </p>
<br><br><br>

<h1> ESSENTIAL SUPPLEMENTS</h1>
<p>When you are toning up, it is important to supplement with a few essentials, as you are putting your body through pretty strict training regimes, so it’s imperative to make sure you are not lacking in anything. Essential supplements for your journey should include:
Vitamin C and multi vit – This will help to keep your immune system strong. 
BCAA’s/Amino acids – These will protect your muscles when you train and help with muscle soreness. 
Iron – Iron will stop you feeling lethargic and fatigued.</p>
<br><br><br>

<h1> YOU NEED TO REST, TOO…</h1>
<p>During your rest days, your broken, stretched and damaged muscle fibres need a chance to repair. Rest days are so important because, without them, you simply won't grow or repair (or tone up). If you trained constantly, then your muscle fibres would constantly be in a state of disarray, and would never have time to heal.
Before you start your week training, ensure you are clever about your rest days and schedule them in strategically so your body can really benefit. If you have beneficial rest days and well timed rest days your training and growth will both improve.</p>
